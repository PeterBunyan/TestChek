# TestChek


# Synopsis
This is an in-progress ASP.net MVC and Web API application. It is designed to simulate a website where healthcare providers can order tests on patients and users (i.e. patients) can log in and access their medical records as soon as they are completed, 
as opposed to waiting for a letter in the mail or a phone call. Additionally, visitors of the website can find resources for learning about specific tests (e.g. the purpose of specific tests and what result values indicate) and laboratory testing, in general.

# Useage
Download zip file and, after unzipping, open the solution file in Microsoft Visual Studio. Build ("Ctrl"+"Shift"+"B") and run the application.
This should open your web browser and direct you to the "Welcome" page of the website. Browse the "F.A.Q." or "About Us" sections for information about laboratory testing or the TestChek company.
Additionaly, you may create an account through the "Register" link on the navigation bar. Once created, you may access the "My Account" section and view a set of laboratory test results that represents a recent visit to a healthcare provider.

# Purpose
As a medical laboratory scientist, I'm familiar with the issues patients and medical providers face when trying to get test results.
This application is an attempt to solve this issue while also demonstrating a basic understanding of the fundamentals of web development using Asp.net MVC and Web API, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, etc.

# Contributors
A combination of the Bootstrap, Asp.net MVC, and Asp.net Web API frameworks, along with a navigation bar template from www.bootswatch.com and several third-party libraries, upon which I have added my own code.

# License
I claim no license over the code contained within the “TestChek” project files.
